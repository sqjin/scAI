# scAI: a single cell Aggregation and Integration method for analyzing single cell multi-omics data

- scAI is an unsupervised approach for integrative analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility or DNA methylation profiles measured in the same individual cells.
- scAI infers a set of biologically relevant factors, which enable various downstream analyses, including the identification of cell clusters, cluster-specific markers and regulatory relationships. 
- scAI provides an intuitive way to visualize features (i.e., genes and loci) alongside the cells in two dimensions.
- scAI aggegrates chromatin profiles of similar cells in an unsupervised and iterative manner, which opens up new avenues for analyzing extremely sparse, binary scATAC-seq data. 

Once the single cell multi-omics data are decomposed into multiple biologically relevant factors, the package provides functionality for further data exploration, analysis, and visualization. Users can:

- Visualize the latent biological patterns of the multi-omics data
- Visualize both genes and loci alongside cells onto the same two-dimensional space
- Identify cell clusters from the inferred joint cell loading matrix and cluster-specific markers
- Visualize clusters and gene expression in the low-dimensional space such as VscAI, t-SNE and UMAP
- Infer regulatory relationships between cluster-specific chromatin region and marker genes

Check out [our paper (Suoqin Jin#, Lihua Zhang# & Qing Nie*, Genome Biology, 2020)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-1932-8) for the detailed methods and applications. 


## Packages
scAI has been implemented as both **R package** and **MATLAB package** under the license GPL-3. In each package, we provide example workflows that outline the key steps and unique features of scAI. The **MATLAB package and examples** are available [here](https://github.com/amsszlh/scAI).


## Installation of R package

### Install from Github using devtools 

```
devtools::install_github("sqjin/scAI")
```

### Install from R source codes
Download source codes [here](https://github.com/sqjin/scAI/blob/master/scAI_1.0.0.tar.gz) and type (in R)
```
install.packages(path_to_file, type = 'source', rep = NULL) # The path_to_file would represent the full path and file name
```
This [website](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/build.html) shows other ways for building and installing an R package.

## Suggestions for speeding up on large-scale datasets

### Using the Python implementation of scAI model
```
object <- run_scAI(object, K, do.fast = TRUE)
```

### Feature selection

Feature selection can reduce the running time in both scAI model and downstream analysis such as dimension reduction.

- Using informative genes for scRNA-seq data: 

The most informative genes can be selected based on their average expression and Fano factor (see [our paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-1932-8) for details).
```
object <- selectFeatures(object, assay = "RNA")
object <- run_scAI(object, K, do.fast = TRUE, hvg.use1 = TRUE)
```
- Using informative loci for scATAC-seq or single cell methylation data: 

Unlike scRNA-seq data, the largely binary nature of scATAC-seq data makes it challenging to perform ‘variable’ feature selection. One option is to select the nearby chromosome regions of the informative genes. 
```
object <- selectFeatures(object, assay = "RNA")
loci.use <- searchGeneRegions(genes = object@var.features[[1]], species = "mouse")
object@var.features[[2]] <- loci.use
object <- run_scAI(object, K, do.fast = TRUE, hvg.use1 = TRUE, hvg.use2 = TRUE)
```

Another option is to use only the top n% of features or remove features present in less that n cells. This method is used in [Signac](https://satijalab.org/signac/articles/pbmc_vignette.html). 


## Additional installation steps (possibly)

- Please consider install [RcppEigen](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppEigen) and [rfunctions](https://github.com/jaredhuling/rfunctions) if they are not automatically installed.
```
if(!require(devtools)){ install.packages("devtools")}
install.packages("RcppEigen")
devtools::install_github("jaredhuling/rfunctions")
```
**Troubleshooting**: Installing RcppEigen and rfunctions on R>=3.5 requires Clang >= 6 and gfortran-6.1. For MacOS, it's recommended to follow guidance on the official R page [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/) OR the [post](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos-before-r-3.6.0/).  For Windows, please ensure that [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is installed. 


- Install other dependencies

scAI provides functionality for further data exploration, analysis, and visualization. A couple of excellent packages need to be installed. 
```
library(devtools)
install_github('linxihui/NNLM')
install_github("yanwu2014/swne")
install_github("jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap")
```
- Install Leiden algorithm for identifying cell clusters: pip install leidenalg. Please check [here](https://github.com/vtraag/leidenalg) if there is any trouble.

- Install UMAP and FIt-SNE for faster dimension reduction in `reducedDims`

Using UMAP and FIt-SNE is recommended for computational efficiency when using `reducedDims` on very large datasets.

-- install UMAP Python package: pip install umap-learn. Please check [here](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) if there is any trouble. 

-- install FIt-SNE R package:  Installing and compiling the necessary software requires the use of FIt-SNE and FFTW. For detailed instructions of installation, please visit this [page](https://github.com/KlugerLab/FIt-SNE).


### Troubleshooting on the R Compiler Tools for Rcpp on macOS
If you get the error "clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'" when installing R package, please consider the configuration in ~/.R/Makevars and see this [post](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos-before-r-3.6.0/) for detailed configuration. In addition, you may can also reinstall your R because -fopenmp option is usually added by R automatically if openmp is available.

If you are using macOS Mojave Version (10.14) and you might get the error "/usr/local/clang6/bin/../include/c++/v1/math.h:301:15: fatal error: 'math.h' file not found", please check the [post](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/922). This error can be solved if running the following on the terminal:

```
sudo installer -pkg \
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg \
-target /
```
